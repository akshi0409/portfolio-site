                        <p class="about-text">
                            I am from Jamshedpur, Jharkhand.<br>
                            I am currently in the sophomore year of my college. I study in Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology.<br>
                            I have always been interested in computer science ever since i learned the subject in school.<br> 
                            Also last year when i joined college I started learning web development and then 
                            I joined joined a society in which I learn more about how it works and now when I was recently introduced to the dsa course 
                            I was really inquisitive about it, and since this course is ongoing right now, I am learning more about it each day and 
                            getting to know new techniques and concepts and it is really very interesting.<br>
                            So yeah, that is all about me.
